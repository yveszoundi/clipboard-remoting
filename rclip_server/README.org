#+TITLE: rclip-server README

* What is this?

This is the clipboard server command-line application (TCP server).
- It stores the latest clipboard value published by clients (=rclip-client=)
- It responds to few commands (READ, WRITE, CLEAR)
  - /READ/:  get the current clipboard text
  - /WRITE/:  store clipboard text
  - /CLEAR/:  clear the current clibpoard text

* What is required?

- *For execution*: Linux, MacOS, Windows or BSD (FreeBSD, NetBSD, OpenBSD)
- *For builds*: A [[https://www.rust-lang.org/][rust]] compiler and the [[https://doc.rust-lang.org/cargo/][cargo]] build tool

* How to build this?

At the root of this project, open a command prompt and type =cargo build=.

* How to run this?

** Display help

#+begin_src sh
./target/debug/rclip-server --help
#+end_src

** Starts the server with default options

The command below starts the server on port =10080= and binds to =127.0.0.1=.

#+begin_src sh
  ./target/release/rclip-server --der-cert-pub rclip-der-cert-pub.der --der-cert-priv rclip-der-cert-priv.der
#+end_src

* How to configure this?

It can become inconvenient to continously provide known command-line parameters.

*** Optional sample configuration file

*The server configuration file name is "/config-server.toml/"*.

#+begin_src conf-toml
  title = "rclip server configuration"

  [server]
  port = 10080
  host = "17.0.0.1"

  [certificate]
  #der-cert-pub = "/home/user/.local/share/rclip/der-cert-pub.der"
  #der-cert-priv = "/home/user/.local/share/rclip/der-cert-priv.der"
#+end_src

/If the certificate paths are not explictly provided, they are resolved from a pre-defined location, per next section/.

*** Configuration data location

Notes:
- Under MacOS and Windows, the configuration and certificate files reside in the same folder.
- Under Linux/BSD, the config file is under =$XDG_CONFIG_HOME= and the certificates will be looked up under =$XDG_DATA_HOME=.

| Operating System | Location                                            |
|------------------+-----------------------------------------------------|
| Under Linux/BSD  | =$XDG_CONFIG_HOME/rclip= and =$XDG_DATA_HOME/rclip= |
| Under MacOS      | =$HOME/Library/Application\ Support/rclip=          |
| Under Windows    | =%APPDATA%\rclip=                                   |
|------------------+-----------------------------------------------------|


* How does it work?

The server is a basic TCP server with a custom text-based protocol (instead of JSON or other formats).
