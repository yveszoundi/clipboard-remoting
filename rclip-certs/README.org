* What is this?
=rclip= now requires SSL for encrypting traffic over the network (local network by default).
- In early versions, all the data was passed around in plain text, which could be problematic (sensitive data such as passwords).
- While the primary use case of =rclip= is text sharing within an internal machine network (host and local virtual machines), you can probably share clipboard text over the internet or the intranet.

* How is this being used?

On the host running the =rclip server=, a self-signed certificate is generated (Please check the =make_cert.sh= script).
- The public and private keys are exported in [[https://wiki.openssl.org/index.php/DER][DER]] format.
- The public key then needs to be copied to all the machines running the =rclip client=, via [[https://linux.die.net/man/1/scp][scp]] for example.

* What is required?
Please use the =make_cert.sh= script to generate self-signed SSL certificates.

You'll need a recent enough version of [[https://www.openssl.org/][OpenSSL]] for "extended arguments" (DNS and IP address of the server).

** Under Linux, MacOS or BSD
- On MacOS, please adjust the script as needed to reflect the location of your =openssl= command. It needs to be a recent version instead of the default shipping with MacOS (i.e. [[https://brew.sh/][Homebrew]] installation of openssl).
- On other UNIX/Linux systems, the default =openssl= command is invoked.

** Under Windows
- You can either install OpenSSL via a package manager ([[https://community.chocolatey.org/packages/openssl][Chocolatey]], [[https://winget.run/pkg/ShiningLight/OpenSSL][Winget]], etc.) or via any Windows binary available.
- [[https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wsl/install][WSL]] probaly provides a recent OpenSSL version out of the box.
