* What is this?
=rclip= is a minimal client-server solution that allows sharing clipboard text over a network.

- =rclip= was created because I wasn't able to quickly get [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/QEMU][QEMU]] working ([[https://gitlab.freedesktop.org/spice/spice/-/issues/39][spice support]]).
- Going forward, I also need a simple clipboard solution that provides a consistent workflow:
  - Interoperability with several operating systems (Linux, MacOS, Windows, BSD).
  - Independence from the virtualization tool ([[https://www.qemu.org/][QEMU]], [[https://www.vmware.com/nl/products/workstation-player.html][VMWare]], etc.).

The primary use-case is clipboard-sharing (text only) within a local network (host and guest virtual machines).

* What does it look like?

In the screenshot below, text is copied from a Mac OS computer to an Ubuntu Linux virtual machine.
- The =rclip= graphical desktop client is used on Mac OS ("Write" button, after copying text in the browser)
- Under Linux, the =rclip= command-line client is invoked (keyboard shortcuts, personal preferences)

* Where to get it?

Please checkout the [[https://github.com/yveszoundi/rclip/releases][releases]] page.

* How to use this?

1. On the =server= machine ([[./rclip_server][rclip-server]]):
  - Generate certificate files accordingly to the documentation in the =support= directory.
  - Copy the =rclip-server= binary to the location of your choice.
  - Optionally, create optionally a configuration file, with certificates keys at pre-defined locations
  - Run the =rclip-server=.
2. On the =client= machine(s) ([[./rclip_client][rclip-client]]):
   - Upload the server =public key= and the =rclip-client= binary
   - Create optionally a configuration file, with the public certificate key at pre-defined locations
   - Start sharing textual content across machines via the =rclip-client= (GUI or CLI client).

I run the =rclip-server= inside an [[https://www.alpinelinux.org/][Alpine Linux]] virtual machine (100 MB of RAM allocated).

* What is required?

** Runtime dependencies

- *Operating System*: Linux, MacOS, Windows, BSD (FreeBSD, OpenBSD, NetBSD).
- *Pre-Built binaries*: There are binaries published for Windows, MacOS, Linux and BSD (CLI only).
- *On Linux and BSD systems*
  - For the [[./rclip_server][rclip-server]], a standalone statically-built binary is available.
  - For the [[./rclip_client][rclip-client]], additional libraries are required (mostly [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/XCB][XCB]] for clipboard interaction).

** Build dependencies

Please check the [[./rclip_server][rclip-server]] and [[./rclip_client][rclip-client]] folders for instructions (README files).
   
* How does it work?
    
This is more or less how it works (primary use-case illustration).
- The =rclip-server= is started with references to certificate keys (public and private keys)
- The =rclip-server= public key is copied to each machine running the =rclip-client=
- Each machine running the =rclip-client= can exchange text over a network via the =rclip-server=
