* What is this?
=rclip= is a simple client-server solution that allows sharing clipboard text over a network.

- =rclip= was created because I wasn't able to quickly get [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/QEMU][QEMU]] working ([[https://gitlab.freedesktop.org/spice/spice/-/issues/39][spice support]]).
- Going forward, I also need a simple clipboard solution that provides a consistent workflow:
  - Interoperability with several operating systems (Linux, MacOS, Windows, BSD).
  - Independence from the virtualization tool ([[https://www.qemu.org/][QEMU]], [[https://www.vmware.com/nl/products/workstation-player.html][VMWare]], etc.).

The primary use-case is clipboard-sharing (text only) within a local network (host and guest virtual machines).
    
This is more or less how it works (primary use-case illustration).

*While traffic over SSL is enforced, please do not use for anything sensitive over the Internet!*.

* How to use this?

1. On the =server= machine ([[./rclip_server][rclip-server]]):
  - Generate certificate files accordingly to the documentation in the =support= directory.
  - Copy the =rclip-server= binary to the location of your choice.
  - Optionally, create optionally a configuration file, with certificates keys at pre-defined locations
  - Run the =rclip-server=.
2. On the =client= machine(s) ([[./rclip_client][rclip-client]]):
   - Upload the server =public key= and the =rclip-client= binary
   - Create optionally a configuration file, with the public certificate key at pre-defined locations
   - Start sharing textual content across machines via the =rclip-client= (GUI or CLI client).

I run the =rclip-server= inside an [[https://www.alpinelinux.org/][Alpine Linux]] virtual machine (100 MB of RAM allocated).

* What is required?

** Runtime dependencies

- *Operating System*: Linux, MacOS, Windows, BSD (FreeBSD, OpenBSD, NetBSD).
- *Pre-Built binaries*: There are binaries published for Windows, MacOS, Linux and BSD (CLI only).
- *On Linux and BSD systems*
  - For the [[./rclip-server][rclip-server]], a standalone statically-built binary is available.
  - For the [[./rclip-client][rclip-client]], additional libraries are required (mostly [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/XCB][XCB]] for clipboard interaction).

** Build dependencies and other notes:

- If you cannot use pre-built binaries or if you would rather build it yourself, please check the =rclip-server= and =rclip-client= folders for instructions.
- The graphical user interface doesn't build on BSD platforms, you can only use the command-line client.
- On UNIX-like systems, only =X11= has been tested for the clipboard client (=rclip-client=), but =Wayland= should work
