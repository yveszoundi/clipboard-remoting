#+TITLE: README

* What is this?

A *quick and very dirty* clipboard exchange solution over a network, built out of unwarranted frustration.

*Please do not use for anything sensitive!*

* How is this being used?

I leverage this tool mostly within Linux virtual machines running a tiling window manager (dwm, etc.).

On the machine where I'm copying text from:
- =C-c= pushes selected text to the local machine clipboard
- =C-t Shift-C-c= sends the local machine clipboard contents to the remote clipboard server

On the target machine, where I want to paste text:
- =C-t Shit-v= reads the remote clipboard server contents and puts it in the local machine clipboard
- =C-v= pastes the fetched remote clipboard contents

* What is required?

- *Operating System*: Linux or MacOS. Windows and BSD systems haven't been tested yet.
- A rust compiler and the cargo build tool

* Why this?

I needed a clipboard solution for multiple machines over a network (mostly a MacOS host and several UNIX/Linux virtual machines):
- I didn't want anything fancy with SSH ([[https://stackoverflow.com/questions/1152362/how-to-send-data-to-local-clipboard-from-a-remote-ssh-session][reverse SSH tunnels]], [[https://www.xquartz.org/][XQuartz]], etc.):
  - I do not want to transfer simple text over SSH
  - I only run an SSH server on some of the guest virtual machines but "almost never" on the host machine itself
- I wasn't able to get [[https://gitlab.freedesktop.org/spice/spice/-/issues/39][spice support]] ready to go for MacOS after few hours.


* What is next?

I do not have any immediate plans for this tool, as it fits my main use cases:
- Copy small configurations for text files between a host and/or several guest virtual machines
- Copy URLs around

I've been thinking about a virtual machine with networking disabled for managing secrets (passwords, keys, etc.), on machines where I don't have Qubes OS.
- Encryption will likely be required for data transfer SSL and probably something else wrapped into base64
- Avoid piping data to auxiliary programs such as xclip, [[https://github.com/tektronix/numconverter/pull/22/files#diff-42cb6807ad74b3e201c5a7ca98b911c5fa08380e942be6e4ac5807f8377f87fcR144][x11 hacks]] to get a persistent keyboard [[https://stackoverflow.com/questions/60137686/how-to-store-text-on-the-system-clipboard-after-application-has-quit-using-gtk3][without many extra libraries]].
