#+TITLE: README

* What is this?

A *quick and very dirty* clipboard exchange solution over a network, built out of unwarranted frustration.
- I wasn't able to get [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/QEMU][QEMU]] [[https://gitlab.freedesktop.org/spice/spice/-/issues/39][spice support]] ready to go for MacOS after few hours
- Even though, I managed later to fix =spice related= compilation issues, I don't think that I'll enable it or change my current workflow

This is more or less how it works

*Please do not use for anything sensitive!*

* How is this being used?

I leverage this tool mostly within Linux virtual machines running a tiling window manager ([[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dwm][dwm]], etc.).

On the machine where I'm copying text from:
- =C-c= pushes selected text to the local machine clipboard
- =C-t Shift-C-c= sends the local machine clipboard contents to the remote clipboard server (in =dwm=)

On the target machine, where I want to paste text:
- =C-t Shit-v= reads the remote clipboard server contents and puts it in the local machine clipboard (in =dwm=)
- =C-v= pastes the fetched remote clipboard contents

* What is required?

- *Operating System*: Linux or MacOS. Windows and BSD systems haven't been tested yet.
- A rust compiler and the cargo build tool

* Why this?

I needed a clipboard solution for multiple machines over a network (mostly a MacOS host and several UNIX/Linux virtual machines):
- I didn't want anything fancy with SSH ([[https://stackoverflow.com/questions/1152362/how-to-send-data-to-local-clipboard-from-a-remote-ssh-session][reverse SSH tunnels]], [[https://www.xquartz.org/][XQuartz]], etc.):
  - I do not want to transfer simple text over SSH
  - I only run an SSH server on some of the guest virtual machines but "almost never" on the host machine itself
- I wasn't able to get [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/QEMU][QEMU]] [[https://gitlab.freedesktop.org/spice/spice/-/issues/39][spice support]] ready to go for MacOS after few hours.


* What is next?

- [ ] Standard message format (JSON, XML, etc.)
- [ ] Standard communication protocol (RPC, REST, etc.)
- [ ] Rethink communication model (agent or actor, vs pulling data on demand)
- [ ] Rethink the main purpose of this project (Passing simple data around or other features such as clipboard history, etc.)
