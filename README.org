* What is this?

A *quick and very dirty* solution for sharing text over a network, in a multi-virtual-machine environment scenario.
- I wasn't able to get [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/QEMU][QEMU]] [[https://gitlab.freedesktop.org/spice/spice/-/issues/39][spice support]] ready to go for MacOS after few hours, nor did I want to implement more involved solutions
- Even though, I later managed to fix =spice support= issues, I won't be using it:
  - I often need to copy text between several operating systems (Linux, BSD, MacOS, Windows)
  - No need to worry about common "clipboard service agent" issues
    - Is it still running? Did it crash or get stuck?
    - Does it only work under specific operating systems?

This is more or less how it works.

* How is this being used?

** Overview
- Under Windows, the clipboard GUI client is leveraged
- Under MacOS, the clipboard CLI client is invoked from scripts (AppleScript scripts, MacOS menu bar)
- Under Linux or BSD, the clipboard CLI client is invoked from keyboard shortcuts within a tiling window manager ([[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dwm][dwm]], etc.).

  
** Usage scenario with dwm, under Linux/BSD
  
On the machine where I'm copying text from:
- =ctrl-c= pushes selected text to the local machine clipboard
- =ctrl-t shift-c= sends the local machine clipboard contents to the remote clipboard server

On the target machine, where I want to paste text:
- =ctrl-t shift-v= reads the remote clipboard server contents and puts it in the local machine  clipboard
- =ctrl-v= pastes the newly fetched remote clipboard contents

* What is required?

- *Operating System*: Linux, MacOS, Windows, BSD
- If provided binaries don't work (Linux distributions), then you'll need to build the programs yourself

  /Please note that the graphical user interface doesn't build under BSD platforms, you can only use the command-line client/.

* What is potentially next?

- [ ] Using a standard message format (JSON, XML, etc.)
- [ ] Leveraging a standard communication approach (RPC, REST, etc.)
- [ ] Add SSL support
- [ ] Rethink communication model (agent, actor)
- [ ] Rethink the main purpose of this project
  - Passing only plain text forever?
  - Adding other features such as clipboard history, etc.
