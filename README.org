* What is this?
=rclip= is a simple solution that allows sharing clipboard data (text only), over a network (local or internet).

- =rclip= was created because I wasn't able to quickly get a simple solution working for [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/QEMU][QEMU]] ([[https://gitlab.freedesktop.org/spice/spice/-/issues/39][spice support]])
- Going forward, I also need a simple clipboard solution that provides a consistent workflow:
  - The tool should work on several operating systems (Linux, MacOS, Windows, FreeBSD, NetBSD and OpenBSD).
  - The tool should behave more or less the same regardless of the virtualization option ([[https://www.qemu.org/][QEMU]], [[https://www.vmware.com/nl/products/workstation-player.html][VMWare]], [[https://www.virtualbox.org/][VirtualBox]], etc.).

This is more or less how it works.

While SSL support has been added, *please do not use for anything sensitive over the Internet!*. The primary use case is for sharing text over an internal local machine network (between a host and guest virtual machines).

* How is this being used?

** Overview

1. On the =server=:
   - Generate certificate files accordingly to the documentation in the =rclip-certs= folder.
   - Copy the =rclip-server= binary to the location of your choice.
2. Upload the =public key= and the =rclip-client= binary to all the machines communicating with the the server =rclip-server=.
3. Run the =rclip-server=.
4. Start sharing textual content via the =rclip-client= (GUI or CLI client).
  
** Client usage under Linux/BSD

I use a tiling window manager under UNIX like platforms (typically [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dwm][dwm]]).

On the /source machine/ where I'm copying text from:
- =ctrl-c= copies selected text to the local machine clipboard.
- =ctrl-t shift-c= sends the local machine clipboard contents to the remote clipboard server.

On the /target machine/, where I want to paste text to:
- =ctrl-t shift-v= fetches the remote clipboard server into the local machine clipboard.
- =ctrl-v= pastes text from the local machine clipboard.
  
** Client usage under MacOS

Instead of the GUI client, it's more convenient IMHO to [[https://apple.stackexchange.com/questions/235167/how-to-run-a-shell-script-from-an-applescript][wrap the CLI client with "AppleScript"]]. The scripts can be [[https://support.apple.com/guide/script-editor/access-scripts-using-the-script-menu-scpedt27975/mac][invoked from the global menubar]].

That would result effectively into 3 scripts for the supported =rclip= operations (READ, WRITE and CLEAR).

** Usage scenario under Windows

The GUI client is more user friendly. In the future, it might be worth looking into a popup menu (i.e. tray icon in the taskbar).

* What is required?

- *Operating System*: Linux, MacOS, Windows, BSD (FreeBSD, OpenBSD, NetBSD).
- Please consult the =rclip-server= and =rclip-client= folders for build instructions.
- There are binaries published for Windows, MacOS, Linux (CLI only pre-built) and BSD (CLI only pre-built).


Notes:
- Pre-built desktop GUI binaries are not available for Linux, as it requires building against every single target Linux distribution (dynamic linking issues, version of dependencies, etc.).
- Please note that the graphical user interface doesn't build under BSD platforms, you can only use the command-line client.

* What is potentially next?

- [X] SSL support.
- [X] Optional default configuration files.
- [ ] Deal with Linux binaries across multiple distros and dynamic linking (GLIBC versions, Musl things).
- [ ] Using a standard message format (JSON, XML, etc.).
- [ ] Rethink the main purpose of this project.
  - [ ] Passing only plain text forever? this is also due to a library dependency?
  - [ ] Adding other features such as clipboard history, etc.
