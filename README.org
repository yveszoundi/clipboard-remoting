#+TITLE: README

* What is this?
=rclip= is a minimal client-server solution that allows sharing clipboard text over a network.

The application was created because I wasn't able to quickly get [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/QEMU][QEMU]] working ([[https://gitlab.freedesktop.org/spice/spice/-/issues/39][spice support]])
- It is independent from specific virtualization tool ([[https://www.qemu.org/][QEMU]], [[https://www.vmware.com/nl/products/workstation-player.html][VMWare]], etc.)
- It works on several operating systems (Linux, Mac OS, Windows, BSD)
- It allows moving clipboard (plain text format) around, via TCP connections

The primary use-case is clipboard-sharing (text only) within a local network (host and guest virtual machines).

* What does it look like?

In the screenshot below, text is copied from a Mac OS computer to an Ubuntu Linux virtual machine.
- The =rclip= graphical desktop client is used on Mac OS ("Write" button click, after copying text from the browser)
- Under Linux, the =rclip= command-line client is invoked (keyboard shortcuts, personal preferences)

* Where to get it?

=rclip= is available for Linux, Mac OS, Windows and BSD systems. Please checkout the [[https://github.com/yveszoundi/rclip/releases][releases]] page for downloads.

* How to use this?

1. On the =server= machine ([[./rclip_server][rclip-server]]):
  - Generate certificate files accordingly to the documentation in the =support= directory.
  - Copy the =rclip-server= binary to the location of your choice.
  - Optionally, create optionally a configuration file, with certificates keys at pre-defined locations
  - Run the =rclip-server=.
2. On the =client= machine(s) ([[./rclip_client][rclip-client]]):
   - Upload the server =public key= and the =rclip-client= binary
   - Create optionally a configuration file, with the public certificate key at pre-defined locations
   - Start sharing textual content across machines via the =rclip-client= (GUI or CLI client)

I run the =rclip-server= inside an [[https://www.alpinelinux.org/][Alpine Linux]] virtual machine (100 MB of RAM allocated).
