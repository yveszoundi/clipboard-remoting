#+TITLE: rclip-client README

* What is this?

This is the command-line client and it's been tested under various Linux distributions, BSD, MacOS and Windows (10 & 11).

* What is required?

- *Operating System*: Linux, MacOS. Minimal testing for Windows so far and pending checks for BSD distributions.
- *Build Tools*: A rust compiler and the cargo build tool.
- *Tools and Libraries under Linux*: Under Debian-like distributions the following packages are required: =libxcb1-dev=, =libxcb-render0-dev=, =libxcb-shape0-dev=, =libxcb-xfixes0-dev=. For other distributions, packages might have a sligthly different naming.
- *[[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/X_Window_System][X11/X.Org]]* under Linux and BSD platforms: specialized code was added for [[https://unix.stackexchange.com/questions/450508/how-to-keep-clipboard-content-from-xterm-after-closing-it-like-firefox-or-le][clipboard persistence]] mitigation. It's possible that the application works just fine under [[https://wayland.freedesktop.org/][Wayland]] but this hasn't been tested.

* How to build this?

** MacOS, Linux and Windows

#+begin_src sh
  cargo build
#+end_src

** FreeBSD, NetBSD and OpenBSD

The GUI is not available for BSD operating systems (FLTK UI toolkit compilation issues).

#+begin_src sh
  cargo build --bin rclip-client-cli
#+end_src

* How to run this?

Please refer to the top level folder for desktop or command-line screenshots.

** Desktop user interface

*This merely exists for very occasional usage under Windows:
- Under Linux (tiling window manager preference), I invoke the CLI client via wrapper shell scripts
- Under MacOS, wrapper shell scripts (AppleScript) accessed via the global menubar are more convenient

The "ideal workflow" is interacting with the command-line version via keyboard shortcuts (Linux tiling Window Manager or maybe keyboard macros?).

** Command-line user interface

*** Display help

Pass the =--help= flag for an exhaustive list of command-line options

#+begin_src sh
./target/debug/rclip-client-cli --help
#+end_src

*** Read contents from the clipboard server

Without any arguments, the following flags are defaulted.

|-------------+---------------|
| Flag        | Default Value |
|-------------+---------------|
| =--command= | =READ=        |
| =--host=    | =127.0.0.1=   |
| =--port=    | =10080=       |
|-------------+---------------|

#+begin_src sh
./target/debug/rclip-client-cli --der-cert-pub pub_key_file_location.der
#+end_src

*** Write contents to the clipboard server

**** With specific text

#+begin_src sh
  ./target/debug/rclip-client-cli --command WRITE --text new_clipboard_contents --der-cert-pub pub_key_file_location.der
#+end_src

**** With data from the clipboard

#+begin_src sh
  ./target/debug/rclip-client-cli --command WRITE --der-cert-pub pub_key_file_location.der
#+end_src

** Optional configuration file

It can become inconvenient to continously provide known command-line parameters.

*** Sample configuration file

#+begin_src conf-toml
  title = "rclip client configuration"

  [server]
  port = 10080
  host = "127.0.0.1"

  [certificate]
  #der-cert-pub = "/home/user/.local/share/rclip/der-cert-pub.der"
#+end_src

/If the public certificate path is not explictly provided, it's resolved from a pre-defined location, per next section/.

*** Configuration data location

Notes:
- Under MacOS and Windows, the configuration file and public certificate reside in the same folder.
- Under Linux/BSD, the config file is under =$XDG_CONFIG_HOME= and the public certificate is under =$XDG_DATA_HOME=.
